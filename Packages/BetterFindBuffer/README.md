## Installation
You can install via [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
Or you can clone this repo into your Sublime Text Packages folder.

## Changing color scheme
If you don't like colors used in the find results buffer just copy [this file](https://github.com/aziz/BetterFindBuffer/blob/master/FindResults.hidden-tmTheme) to your User folder, change colors and save it and then create a file called `Find Results.sublime-settings` in your User folder and paste the code below:

``` json
{
  "color_scheme": "Path to your custom color scheme file. e.g. Packages/User/Custom_FindResults.hidden-tmTheme",
}
```

Alternatively, you can use [BetterFindBuffer-Designer](http://bobtherobot.github.io/BetterFindBuffer-Designer/) tool as GUI to easily customize the Find-Results color scheme.
